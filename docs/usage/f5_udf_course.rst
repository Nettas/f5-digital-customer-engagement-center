F5 UDF Environment Access - Course
**********************************

F5 has an internal Universal Development Framework (UDF_) with courses containing solutions. The benefit of utilizing UDF courses with blueprints is access to cloud accounts (AWS), clean-up, and cost. It also provides a consistent experience for attendees, with no dependencies installed on a client computer.

A jumphost comes configured with instances, packages, and software within this course, making solutions run easier.

The course for this project is called **F5 Digital Engagement Center**

.. note:: These steps are from the initial UDF registration email. If you have already logged into UDF, you can skip to Step 6

The following steps will log you into the course:

1. An email should have arrived from **noreply@registration.udf.f5.com** at your registration email

9. At the bottom of the Documentation page are UDF Cloud Accounts. These accounts are created by creating the environment and deleted after the environment is stopped. They are ephemeral. This account information is used in different courses. Please make a note of the location. This ephemeral account has access to Services noted either programmatically or through an AWS console.

11. When accessing Coder, a simple password has been created, ``password``

   .. note:: Coder in its most basic form is VSCode in a web browser. It has access to all VSCode extensions and tools.

   For users of VSCode, the screen should be very familiar. VSCode is an extendable IDE for users not aware, allowing you to craft and interact programmatically with systems.
