AWS Edge with F5 Device-Id - Lab setup
-----------------------------------------------------

This solution will use AWS services to host the web application and leverage AWS edge services. We are Using Terraform for building the AWS services.

Prior knowledge of AWS or Terraform is not needed. The solution aims for a smaller learning curve on infrastructure (with abstractions) in exchange for more time with Device-Id capabilites.

Terraform_ is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

This solution is leveraging Terraform to create and manage the following products and services.

- Amazon CloudFront
- Amazon WAF
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- Amazon Application Load Balancing (ALB)
- Amazon Auto Scaling
- Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)


- F5 Device-Id+


.. note:: Double-clicking in the empty space to the right of **Welcome** tab in VSCode will create a new file that can be used as a digital notepad

1. Open Cloud9

   Example:

   |image01|

2. Set or verify environment AWS credentials

   .. note:: AWS Access and Secret keys are provided by the instructer

   In the terminal window, copy the below text and paste+enter:

   .. code-block::

      aws configure

   Variables Table for awscli to UDF Cloud Accounts:

   ===================== ===========================================================
   Variable Name         Cloud Account Variable Value
   ===================== ===========================================================
   AWS Access Key ID     API Key
   AWS Secret Access Key API Secret
   Default region name   us-east-1
   Default ouput format  none
   ===================== ===========================================================

   Example:

   |image02|

3. git clone the public repositories containing all code.

   .. note:: Examples are shown pulling the repositories down to the **Desktop** folder. If you choose to change the clone location, be aware of the path

   In the terminal window, copy the below text and paste+enter:

   .. code-block::

      git clone -b 'v1.1.0' --single-branch https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-digital-customer-engagement-center


4. Change directory to the F5 Digital Customer Engagement Center repository

   In the terminal window copy the below text and paste+enter:

   .. code-block::

      cd f5-digital-customer-engagement-center/solutions/security/aws-cf-device-id


5. SSH key for created AWS Resources

   .. note:: For UDF run workshops, an SSH key has already been created for you

   Terraform will need an SSH key for creating resources. create a new one.

   In the terminal window, copy the below text and paste+enter (accept all defaults):

   .. code-block::

      ssh-keygen

   Get the public key you just created, you will need to provide it in the next section:

   .. code-block::

      more ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


6. Modify Terraform admin.auto.tfvars file for deployment.

   .. warning:: ``resourceOwner`` is arbitrary.

   In the terminal window copy the below text and paste+enter:

   .. code-block::

      cp admin.auto.tfvars.example admin.auto.tfvars

   .. code-block::

      sudo vi admin.auto.tfvars

   ============== ===========================================================
   Variable Name   Variable Value
   ============== ===========================================================
   resourceOwner  Arbitrary (i.e. johnc)
   awsRegion      Leave us-west-2
   awsAz1         Leave us-west-2a
   awsAz2         Leave us-west-2b
   sshPublicKey   Copy pasted ssh key from previous step
   ============== ===========================================================

   save and exit file with ``:wq``

   Example:

   |image07|
   |image08|
   |image09|

7. Run the setup script - **This will create AWS resource objects**

   In the terminal window copy the below text and paste+enter:

   .. code-block::

      ./setup.sh

   Example:

   |image10|

8. Accept the Terraform deployment

   ``enter`` when needed

   Example:

   |image11|

9. Terraform Completed

   .. warning:: Terraform is building several services, this can take 10-15 minutes

   .. note:: If you need to see the outputs again later and have not saved them, utilize the ``terraform output`` command.

   The outputs from our Terraform run are in green. We will need this information to access our services and create/publish NGINX into the environment.

   Save the outputs for the next several steps.

   Example:

   |image12|

10. All of the Terraform-created objects are dynamic, so until running the Terraform template they did not exist. Now that the resources are created, we need to apply access to those services.

   .. warning:: Terraform does not know about the changes in this step. If Terraform must be re-run, this step will need to be repeated.

    Step 1: Log in to ECR. Change the ``ecrRepositoryURL`` to the terraform output.

    In the terminal window copy the below text and paste+enter:

    .. code-block::

       aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ecrRepositoryURL

    ECR is used as our registry for the Kubernetes environment. Registries are used to keep container images for  lifecycle and deployments. NGINX Ingress Controller is a container.

    Example:

    |image13|

    Step 2: Log in to EKS. Change the ``kubernetesClusterName`` to the terraform output.

    In the terminal window copy the below text and paste+enter:

    .. code-block::

       aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name kubernetesClusterName

    Kubernetes in this environment will host our application, and we will be using NGINX Ingress Controller to  expose that application.

    Example:

    |image14|

    Step 3: Update the Subnet Tags for the EKS cluster. Change the ``kubernetesClusterName``, ``publicSubnetAZ1`` and ``publicSubnetAZ2`` to  the terraform output.

    In the terminal window copy the below text and paste+enter:

    .. code-block::

       aws ec2 create-tags \
          --resources publicSubnetAZ1 publicSubnetAZ2 \
          --tags Key=kubernetes.io/cluster/kubernetesClusterName,Value=shared   Key=kubernetes.io/role/elb,Value=1

    For EKS to create an Elastic Load Balancer for our Ingress solution, two tags need to be placed on the public subnets. Ideally, Terraform would add the tags. However, the EKS module from Terraform does not manipulate  those. So, we are doing it manually. These issues can be tracked here.

    - issue02_

    Example:

    |image15|

11. The environment has been created, all access has been set.

    At this point, we can deploy our services and provide access.
