Contributions
*************

Contributions to the project are always welcome. Contributors can help with Modules, Solutions, Documentation, and Framework. All `contributions`_ are done through GitHub with issues, branches, and projects.

After the creation of a resource type, individuals or teams are encouraged to update the `codeowners`_ file. This file is used for requiring approvals on Pull Requests. Using codeowners helps reduce the risk a resource owned is modified without notifications and approvals.

All contributors are developers, after deciding how to contribute please read the `Developer Guides`_

Modules
